#MyLocat - Backend API

This is the backend API for "MyLocat", a personal safety web application designed to work with a wearable device. In emergency situations, users can trigger alerts via the wearable, which are handled by this Spring Boot API.

This backend is responsible for:
- Managing emergency contact data
- Storing user location coordinates
- Handling emergency alert triggers
